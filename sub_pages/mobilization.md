## Community mobilization

We want to create a voice dataset that is publicly available to anyone and represents the world we live in. 
By mobilising communities and contributors we are able to achieve this goal. 

This page links to resources and ideas you can use to help advocate for Common Voice in your langauge community.

⭐️ You can re-use any graphical material we have produced to support the project.

You might be asking, how could I use these resources to support my languages growth on Common Voice?

Here are some ideas, for encouraging people [contribute within your social network and at events](https://community.mozilla.org/en/activities/contributing-to-common-voice/)   

We are currently developing a Contribution Cookbook, to highlight best practices from across the community. 
This will include advice on:
- Low-resourced languages
- Community organising during covid-19
- Reward and recognition
- Social media ideas
- Marketing materials
