## Goals for this playbook

* Provide people interested in contributing to Common Voice goals and mission with clear guidelines and expectations on how to set up and run a self-sustaining Common Voice langauge community.
* Unify existing community knowledge previously documented in different places.
* Be the central place to understand the whole voice community journey.
* Communicate what brings value to the project and how communities can support it.

Here is a list of some of the [langauge community channels](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/blob/main/docs/COMMUNITIES.md) that you can take part in.
