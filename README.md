## Vision of Common Voice

## Goals for this playbook

* Provide people interested in contributing to Common Voice goals and mission with clear guidelines and expectations on how to set up and run a self-sustaining Common Voice langauge community.
* Unify existing community knowledge previously documented in different places.
* Be the central place to understand the whole voice community journey.
* Communicate what brings value to the project and how communities can support it.

## Common Voice Ecosystem

Common Voice Ecosystem has a variety of communities that support the project in different important areas, they are usually grouped by language.

Here is a list of some of the [langauge community channels](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/blob/main/docs/COMMUNITIES.md) that you can take part in.

✈️ The journey involves collecting and validating public domain sentences \(1\), recording and validating the recordings of the sentences \(2\), repeating this process to grow the size of the data \(3\), generating a dataset \(4\) and using machine learning to train speech-to-text models using this dataset \(5\).
